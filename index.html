                <p>Let's decide where to go to college by first viewing tuition cost based on state in the United States. 
                    The visualization below shows the average college tuition by state. We can see from the bar chart that
                    private schools are vastly more expensive than public schools.
                    Use the dropdown menu to select between All Colleges, Private Colleges, or Public Colleges. 
                    You can also click on each bar to see more detailed information.</p>

                <p>In the scatter plot below, we can see a comparison of the tuition of each college vs the average income 
                    a graduate makes 10 years after graduating from that school. You can hover over each datapoint to see 
                    more information on the specific school. On the next page, you will be able to filter the data of this plot more.
                    From the data, you can see there is a slightly positive linear relationship with higher tuition schools resulting in 
                    higher paying jobs, but overall the increase in income varies slightly with some colleges being outliers.</p>

                    You can use the sliders to filter by income, tuition cost, and number of students. 
                    You can use the dropdowns to pick type of college and state.
                    The scatter plot will update based on your criteria.</p>
